                Cook bacon in a non-stick pan over medium heat until crisp. Use a slotted spatula to remove the bacon and place it on plate. Do not discard the bacon grease and drippings!

                In the same pan, add onion and cook until translucent.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add cabbage, salt, pepper, paprika and mix everything together. Cook for about 7 minutes or until cabbage is tender.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add bacon back into the pan and mix it together with the cabbage and serve warm.
